<h3> Description</h3> <br>

In this project i built an app to track which books you’ve read and what you thought of them. it’s follow a similar theme of to do list. Here i explore all the skills that i have learned then also learn some new skills that take them all to a new level.

This time i met SwiftData, which is Apple’s framework for working with databases. This project will serve as an introduction for SwiftData, It’s responsible for managing objects in a database, including reading, writing, filtering, sorting, and more, and it’s hugely important in app development for iOS, macOS, and beyond. Previously i used UserDefaults, but that was just a short-term thing to help you along with your learning – SwiftData is the real deal, used by countless thousands of apps.

At the same time, i also built my first custom user interface component – a star rating widget where the user can tap to leave a score for each book. This  introduced me to another property wrapper, called @Binding . @Binding. This lets us share a simple @State property of one view with another, so they both point to the same integer, string, Boolean, and so on.
